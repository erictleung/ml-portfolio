# Iris Data Set

> This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern
> recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is
> referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data
> set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
> type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
> latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
