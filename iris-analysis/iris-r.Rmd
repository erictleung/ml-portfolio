# Introduction

The Iris Data Set was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

"This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other."

1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
5. class: 
    - Iris Setosa 
    - Iris Versicolour 
    - Iris Virginica

    "sepal.length", "sepal.width", 
    "petal.length", "petal.width", 
    "class")
